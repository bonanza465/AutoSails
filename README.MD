# AutoSails

**AutoSails** automatically controls sails in Sailwind. It can hoist, lower, and trim sails based on wind conditions.

## 🔧 Features

* Press **`I`** to hoist or lower sails (depending on current condition)
* Press **`J`** activate the auto trimmer.

## 📦 Requires

To use this mod, you need the following:

* [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) 
* [SailwindModdingHelper by App24](https://thunderstore.io/c/sailwind/p/App24/SailwindModdingHelper/) 


## ⚠️ Important

In its current state the mod can only control simple sails, i.e. gaffs, lateens and junk sails (sails which only have one winch control). Square and jib sails are currently not implemented.

## 🙏 Credits
Much of the implementation was inspired by the SailInfo mod.
